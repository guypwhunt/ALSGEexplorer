## The Data

- GEO: GSE118553
- cite: bioRxiv.org (version 0.1 of the manuscrit)

## DE Gene Explorer

Boxplot and Table of Results for selected gene.

## Limma DE:Full Table

Use the search tabs to subset the table by Tissue/Brain Region, Experiment, logFC, P-value etc.

**Tissues:**

- Entorhinal_Cortex
- Temporal_Cortex
- Frontal_Cortex
- Cerebellum

**Experiment:**

- AsympAD vs CO

- AD vs AsympAD

- AD v CO



## Raw Data Explorer

*If your favourite gene did not pass QC, you can look it up here.*

We present the raw un-processed data and a basic background correceted, log2 transformed,
rsn normalised (Tansformed) data for you to plot. The data was adjusetd for known bacthes using combat, and RIN

**Note:**

- Raw data are not background corrected  

- The Transformed log2(Expression) Values will not be directly comparable to the final full quality controled data  

- For Genes with mulitple probes, the probe with the maximin expression value was selected for plotting
